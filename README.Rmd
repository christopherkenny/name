Organizes functions for `dplyr::rename_with()` in one place with testing and basic documentation.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of name from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("name")
```
-->

You can install the current version of `name` from GitHub.
``` r
devtools::install_github('name')
```

## Example

```{r}
library(name)
library(dplyr)
data(mtcars)
```

We can add a prefix:
```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  rename_with(\(x) add_pref(x, 'pref_'))
```

And similarly a suffix:
```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  rename_with(\(x) add_suff(x, '_suff'))
```

Or a replace a phrase:
```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  rename_with(\(x) repl_phrase(x, '_hp', '_hitpoints'))
```
